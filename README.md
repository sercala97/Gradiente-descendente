Suppose that you are an administrator of a university and you want to know the chance of admission of each applicant based on their two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants which can be used as the training data for logistic regression. Your task is to build a classification model that estimates each applicant’s probability of admission in university (Source:coursera machine learning class and Gondaliya (2013)).

Now, we have understood classification problem that we are going to address. Let us understand the data. In data we have records of previous applicants’ two exams score and label whether applicant got admission or not (1 - if got admission 0 - otherwise).
